 * @brief The Bank of Heather would like to know what would happen if it added a
 * second ATM. Modify the simulation in this chapter so that it has two queues.
 * Assume that a customer will join the first queue if it has fewer people in it
 * than the second queue otherwise. Again, find a value for number of customers
 * per hour that leads to an average wait time of one minute. (NOTE: This is a
 * nonlinear problem in that doubling the number of ATMs doesn't double the
 * number of customers who can be handled per hour with a one-minute wait
 * maximum.)
